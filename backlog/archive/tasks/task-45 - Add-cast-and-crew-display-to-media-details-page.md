## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Display cast and crew information on the media details page from the metadata.

The metadata map contains cast and crew data that should be displayed:
- Show top cast members with photos (if available)
- Display key crew members (director, writer, producer)
- Format in a visually appealing way using cards or grid
- Handle missing cast/crew data gracefully
- Consider responsive layout for mobile

This was mentioned in the original task-39 description but not implemented.
