## 12.0.16
### Patch Changes



- [#2320](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/pull/2320) [`deafdc0`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/commit/deafdc00e388ed195c2cdf77e98cd19e7d496d48) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Fix `@stream` directive not working for federated subgraphs with non-null scalar list return types.
  
  Two bugs were addressed in `delegateRequest`:
  
  1. `isListType` was called without first unwrapping `NonNull`, so a field typed `[String!]!` (a `NonNull(List(...))`) was not recognised as a list. The fix wraps the check with `getNullableType()`.
  
  2. Deduplication of already-pushed stream items used a `WeakSet`, which throws a `TypeError` for primitive values (strings, numbers, etc.). This was replaced with an integer index counter that works for both object and primitive list items.

## 12.0.15
### Patch Changes



- [#2306](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/pull/2306) [`7171b46`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/commit/7171b46546a8e60776f70d18d14dd6fa19d5649f) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Fix incorrect error path when delegating a single type to a list type in a subschema.
  
  When using schema stitching with type merging (e.g., a supergraph `book` field delegating to a subschema `books` list field via batch delegation), errors from the subschema now correctly report the path as seen in the supergraph (e.g., `['book', 'title']`) instead of including an unexpected array index (e.g., `['book', 0, 'title']`).
  
  Also ensures `onLocatedError` is passed through in all branches of `getDelegationContext`.

## 12.0.14
### Patch Changes



- [#2243](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/pull/2243) [`dff525f`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/commit/dff525f214d3525434c5a73a5b3fb22c46550163) Thanks [@qsona](https://github.com/qsona)! - Fix redundant type merging calls when subschemas have no explicit name.
  
  The fallback name-based matching in `resolveExternalValue` (introduced in [#1557](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/issues/1557)) incorrectly matched unrelated subschemas when neither had an explicit `name` set, because `undefined === undefined` evaluated to `true`. This caused type merging to trigger even when fetching a type directly from its source subschema, resulting in a redundant second call.

  - Do not try to resolve types from the subschemas which only have the stub types, for example if a subgraph only has `id` field as a stub, do not use that subgraph as a target subgraph for resolving the type, because it will not have any other fields than `id`.

### Patch Changes



- [#1971](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/pull/1971) [`4065b7f`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/commit/4065b7fbb08d9e75c5f0d3b2b4d42d665aa9dbd9) Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - Reuse the existing variables from the gateway request correctly
  
  When you have an argument in a nested field that uses the variable from the gateway request like below;
  
  ```graphql
      query GetArticles($date: Datetime!) {
          view {
            articlesByDate(date: $date) {
              id
              title
              publishedAt
            }
          }
        }
  ```
  
  And if `Datetime` is renamed from `DateTime` in the original schema, the transform wasn't applied correctly to the variable definitions, and the delegation failed with an error in the subgraph like `Datetime` is not known.

## 12.0.7
### Patch Changes



- [#1948](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/pull/1948) [`584a293`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/commit/584a293e3dafa7cd2d0210f80299c81b6707bcd4) Thanks [@Tolsee](https://github.com/Tolsee)! - Respect existing variable definitions from the gateway request;
  1. If the argument uses a variable definition on the gateway request, keep and re-use it as-is.
  
  ```graphql
  query ($var1: String = "default") {
    rootField(arg1: $var1)
  }
  ```
  
  2. If the argument does not use a variable definition on the gateway request, create a new variable definition for it and make sure it does not conflict with any existing variable definitions on the gateway request, because the gateway request can have variables that have nothing to do with the delegated argument.
  
  ```graphql
  query ($arg1: String = "default") {
    rootField(arg1: 2) {
      someField(arg2: $arg1)
    }
  }
  ```
  
  In that case it should be delegated as:
  
  ```graphql
  query ($arg1: String = "default", $rootField_arg1: String = "default") {
    rootField(arg1: $rootField_arg1) {
      someField(arg2: $arg1)
    }
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes



- [#1901](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/pull/1901) [`e92c5a9`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/commit/e92c5a9702a2aea395a4a4e3a482b92f528655e8) Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - Do not add required fields if they are already present in the original selection set.
  
  For example in Federation;
  
  If you have a subgraph schema like below;
  
  ```graphql
  type Book @key(fields: "upc otherUpc shop { id }") {
      upc: ID!
      otherUpc: ID!
      shop: Shop!
  }
  
  type Shop @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
      location: Location!
  }
  ```
  
  And when you send a mutation like below;
  
  ```graphql
  mutation {
      buyBook(input: { bookUpc: "test" }) {
          book {
              upc
              otherUpc
              shop {
                  id
                  name
                  location {
                      address1
                      city
                      state
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  Previously, the gateway would add the required key fields again to the selection set when resolving the type like below;
  
  ```diff
  mutation {
      buyBook(input: { bookUpc: "test" }) {
          book {
              upc
              otherUpc
  -           upc
  -           otherUpc
  -           shop { id } # from the key fields
              shop {
                  id
                  name
                  location {
                      address1
                      city
                      state
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

## 12.0.3
### Patch Changes



- [#1835](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/pull/1835) [`dcd8f0e`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/commit/dcd8f0e93fd220cb99f79cadea759ea49bc15308) Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - Delegate variable values correctly;
  
  When delegating requests with variables that include nested arrays, ensure that null values are preserved and passed correctly to the subschema. This fix addresses issues where null values in nested arrays were not handled properly during delegation.
  
  Let's say we have the following schema;
  
  ```ts
  makeExecutableSchema({
      typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
          type Query {
              test(input: InputType!): [String!]
          }
          input InputType {
              value: [String!]
          }
      `,
      resolvers: {
          Query: {
              test: (_, args) => {
                  // Returns the incoming variable value
                  return args.input.value;
              },
          },
      }
  });
  ```
  
  When delegating a query with a variable like:
  
  ```json
  {
      "query": "query Test($value: [String!]) { test(input: { value: $value } ) }",
      "variables": { "value": null }
  }
  ```
  
  And the result was
  ```json
  {
      "data": {
          "test": []
      }
  }
  ```
  
  But with this fix, the result will correctly be:
  ```json
  {
      "data": {
          "test": null
      }
  }
  ```

  In case of the following schema;

  ```graphql

  type Baz {
    id: ID!
    name: Name
    age: Int
  }

  type Name {
    first: String
    last: String
  }
  ```

  If the operation is generated as following;

  ```graphql
  query {
    foo {
      id
      name
      age {
        years
        months
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  It should be spreaded on the union type field correctly as following;

  ```graphql
  query {
    foo {
      ... on Bar {
        id
        age {
          years

  Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - When there are two services like below then the
  following query senty, the gateway tries to fetch `id` as an extra field because it considers `id`
  might be needed while this is not correct. This patch avoids any extra calls, and forwards the
  query as is to the 2nd service.

  ```graphql
  query {
    viewer {
      booksContainer(input: $input) {
        edges {
          cursor
          node {

  field in the `Post` type is merged with the selection set for the `authorId` field in the
  `Comment` type.

  is a computed field requires another computed field requires a field from the initial subschema.

  `lastName` already there by mistake.

  Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - Fix extra inline fragments for all abstract types
  in the upstream schema call

  If there are two subschemas like below, the final `Node` interface is implemented by both `Oven`
  and `Toaster` while they are not implemented in both schemas. In this case the query
  `{ products { id ... on Node { id } } }` will need to be transformed to
  `{ products { id ... on Oven { id } ... on Node { id } } }` for the first subschema. But
  previously the query planner was automatically creating inline fragments for all possible types
  which was not optimal. Now it adds inline fragments only if this case is seen.

  ```graphql
  type Query {
    products: [Product]
  }

  union Product = Oven | Toaster

  interface Node {
    id: ID!
  }

  type Oven {
    id: ID!
  }

  type Toaster implements Node {
    id: ID!
    warranty: Int
  }
  ```

  And another one like below;

  ```graphql
  interface Node {
    id: ID!
  }

  type Oven implements Node {
    id: ID!
    warranty: Int
  }
  ```

  Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - Handle interface types with non-shared
  implementations;

  For example, you have the following services, where `Node` is implemented in both services, but
  `Foo` and `Bar` are only implemented in one service. And when the gateway receives the following
  query, it should be converted to this because `Node` is not implemented as `Bar` in Service 1
  while implemented in Service 2.

  Query conversion;

### Patch Changes

  [`a83da08`](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/commit/a83da087e24929ed0734a2cff63c97bd45cc9eb4)
  Thanks [@User](https://github.com/User)! - Ignore unmerged fields

  Let's say you have a gateway schema like in the bottom, and `id` is added to the query, only if
  the `age` is requested;

  ```graphql
  # This will be sent as-is
  {
    user {
      name
    }
  }
  ```

  But the following will be transformed;

  ```graphql
  {
    user {
      name
      age
    }
  }
  ```

  Into

  ````graphql
  {
    user {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }


  ```graphql
  type Query {

  }

  type User {
    id: ID! # is the key for all services
    name: String!
    age: Int! # This comes from another service
  }
  ````

  Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - If there are some fields depending on a nested
  type resolution, wait until it gets resolved then resolve the rest.

  See packages/federation/test/fixtures/complex-entity-call example for more details. You can see
  `ProductList` needs some fields from `Product` to resolve `first`

  [`680351e`](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/commit/680351ee2af39ffd6b4b0048a28954d0d4b8a926)
  Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - When there is a Node subschema, and others to
  resolve the rest of the entities by using a union resolver as in Federation like below, it was
  failing. This version fixes that issue.

  ```graphql
  query {
    node(id: "1") {
      id # Fetches from Node
      ... on User {
        name # Fetches from User
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```graphql
  type Query {
    node(id: ID!): Node
  }

  interface Node {
    id: ID!
  }

  type User implements Node {
    id: ID!
  }

  type Post implements Node {
    id: ID!
  }
  ```

  ```graphql
  # User subschema
  scalar _Any
  type Query {
    _entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
  }
  union _Entity = User
  interface Node {
    id: ID!
  }
  type User implements Node {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }
  ```

  ```graphql
  # Post subschema
  scalar _Any
  union _Entity = Post
  type Query {
    _entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
  }
  interface Node {
    id: ID!
  }
  type Post implements Node {

## 10.0.5

### Patch Changes

- [#6091](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/pull/6091)
  [`9bca9e0`](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/commit/9bca9e03915a2e12d164e355be9aed389b0de3a4)
  Thanks [@User](https://github.com/User), [@User](https://github.com/User)! - If the gateway
  receives a query with an overlapping fields for the subschema, it uses aliases to resolve it
  correctly.

  Let's say subschema A has the following schema;

  ```graphql
    type Query {

    }

    interface User {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
    }

    type Admin implements User {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
      role: String!
    }

    type Customer implements User {
      id: ID!
      name: String
      email: String
    }
  ```

  And let's say the gateway has the following schema instead;

  ```graphql
    type Query {

    }

    interface User {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
    }

    type Admin implements User {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
      role: String!
    }

    type Customer implements User {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
      email: String!
    }
  ```

  In this case, the following query is fine for the gateway but for the subschema, it's not;

  ```graphql
  query {
    user {
      ... on Admin {
        id
        name # This is nullable in the subschema
        role
      }
      ... on Customer {
        id
        name # This is non-nullable in the subschema
        email
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  So the subgraph will throw based on this rule
  [OverlappingFieldsCanBeMerged](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/validation/rules/OverlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule.ts)

  To avoid this, the gateway will use aliases to resolve the query correctly. The query will be
  transformed to the following;

  ```graphql
  query {
    user {
      ... on Admin {
        id
        name # This is nullable in the subschema
        role
      }
      ... on Customer {
        id
        name: _nullable_name # This is non-nullable in the subschema
        email
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - If one of the subgraphs are already able to
  resolve a nested field as in `parent-entity-call` example's `Category.details` from C's `Product`,
  resolve it from there instead of using type merging.

  ```graphql
  query {
    product {
      category {
        details {
          # This is coming from C's Product, so resolve it from there instead of Type Merging
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }

  Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - ## Breaking changes

  **Schema generation optimization by removing `transfomedSchema` parameter**

  Previously we were applying the transforms multiple times. We needed to introduced some breaking
  changes to improve the initial wrapped/stitched schema generation performance;
  - `Transform.transformSchema` no longer accepts `transformedSchema` which can easily be created
    with `applySchemaTransforms(schema, subschemaConfig)` instead.
  - Proxying resolver factory function that is passed as `createProxyingResolver` to
    `SubschemaConfig` no longer takes `transformedSchema` which can easily be created with
    `applySchemaTransforms(schema, subschemaConfig)` instead.

  **`stitchSchemas` doesn't take nested arrays of subschemas**

  `stitchSchemas` no longer accepts an array of arrays of subschema configuration objects. Instead,
  it accepts an array of subschema configuration objects or schema objects directly.

  **`stitchSchemas` no longer prunes the schema with `pruningOptions`**

  You can use `pruneSchema` from `@graphql-tools/utils` to prune the schema instead.

  **`stitchSchemas` no longer respect "@computed" directive if stitchingDirectivesTransformer isn't
  applied**

  Also `@graphql-tools/stitch` no longer exports `computedDirectiveTransformer` and
  `defaultSubschemaConfigTransforms`. Instead, use `@graphql-tools/stitching-directives` package for
  `@computed` directive.
  [Learn more about setting it up](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-stitching/stitch-directives-sdl#directives-glossary)

  **`computedFields` has been removed from the merged type configuration**

  `MergeTypeConfig.computedFields` setting has been removed in favor of new computed field
  configuration written as:

  ```js
  merge: {
    MyType: {
      fields: {
        myComputedField: {
          selectionSet: '{ weight }',
          computed: true,
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  A field-level `selectionSet` specifies field dependencies while the `computed` setting structures
  the field in a way that assures it is always selected with this data provided. The `selectionSet`
  is intentionally generic to support possible future uses. This new pattern organizes all
  field-level configuration (including `canonical`) into a single structure.

- 0bbb1769: Refine generic typings using `extends X` when appropriate

  Typescript 4.7 has stricter requirements around generics which is explained well in the related
  PR: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/48366

  These changes resolve the errors that these packages will face when attempting to upgrade to TS
  4.7 (still in beta at the time of writing this). Landing these changes now will allow other TS
  libraries which depend on these packages to experiment with TS 4.7 in the meantime.

### Major Changes

- 7d3e3006: BREAKING CHANGE
  - Remove `rootValue` from subschemaConfig
  - - Pass it through `ExecutionParams` or delegation options
  - Do not pass `info.rootValue` if `rootValue` is falsy
- d53e3be5: BREAKING CHANGES;

  Refactor the core delegation transforms into individual functions to modify request and results.
  This will improve the performance considerably by reducing the number of visits over the request
  document.
  - Replace `CheckResultAndHandleErrors` with `checkResultAndHandleErrors`
  - Remove `delegationBindings`
  - Replace `AddArgumentsAsVariables`, `AddSelectionSets`, `AddTypenameToAbstract`,
    `ExpandAbstractTypes`, `FilterToSchema`, `VisitSelectionSets` and `WrapConcreteTypes` with
    `prepareGatewayDocument` and `finalizeGatewayRequest`

- dae6dc7b: refactor: ExecutionParams type replaced by Request type

  rootValue property is now a part of the Request type.

  When delegating with delegateToSchema, rootValue can be set multiple ways:
  - when using a custom executor, the custom executor can utilize a rootValue in whichever custom
    way it specifies.
  - when using the default executor (execute/subscribe from graphql-js): -- rootValue can be passed
    to delegateToSchema via a named option -- rootValue can be included within a subschemaConfig --
    otherwise, rootValue is inferred from the originating schema

  When using wrapSchema/stitchSchemas, a subschemaConfig can specify the createProxyingResolver
  function which can pass whatever rootValue it wants to delegateToSchema as above.

- c42e811d: BREAKING CHANGES;
  - Rename `Request` to `ExecutionRequest`
  - Add required `operationType: OperationTypeNode` field in `ExecutionRequest`
  - Add `context` in `createRequest` and `createRequestInfo` instead of `delegateToSchema`

  > It doesn't rely on info.operation.operationType to allow the user to call an operation from
  > different root type. And it doesn't call getOperationAST again and again to get operation type
  > from the document/operation because we have it in Request and ExecutionParams
  > https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/pull/3166/files#diff-d4824895ea613dcc1f710c3ac82e952fe0ca12391b671f70d9f2d90d5656fdceR38

  Improvements;
  - Memoize `defaultExecutor` for a single `GraphQLSchema` so allow `getBatchingExecutor` to memoize
    `batchingExecutor` correctly.
  - And there is no different `defaultExecutor` is created for `subscription` and other operation
    types. Only one executor is used.

  > Batch executor is memoized by `executor` reference but `createDefaultExecutor` didn't memoize
  > the default executor so this memoization wasn't working correctly on `batch-execute` side.
  > https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/blob/remove-info-executor/packages/batch-execute/src/getBatchingExecutor.ts#L9

- 7d3e3006: BREAKING CHANGE
  - Now it uses the native
    [`AggregateError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AggregateError)
    implementation. The major difference is the individual errors are kept under `errors` property
    instead of the object itself with `Symbol.iterator`.
  ```js
  // From;
  for (const error of aggregateError)
  // To;
  for (const error of aggregateError.errors)
  ```
- aa43054d: BREAKING CHANGE: validations are skipped by default, use validateRequest: true to
  reenable
- c0ca3190: BREAKING CHANGE
  - Remove Subscriber and use only Executor
  - - Now `Executor` can receive `AsyncIterable` and subscriptions will also be handled by
      `Executor`. This is a future-proof change for defer, stream and live queries

## 7.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 6aed1714: Allows `MergedTypeConfig` to be written with an `entryPoints` array for multiple merged
  type entry points, each with their own `fieldName` and `selectionSet`:

  ```js
  {
    schema: testSchema,
    merge: {
      Product: {
        entryPoints: [{
          selectionSet: '{ id }',
          fieldName: 'productById',
          key: ({ id, price, weight }) => ({ id, price, weight }),
          argsFromKeys: (key) => ({ key }),
        }, {
          selectionSet: '{ upc }',
          fieldName: 'productByUpc',
          key: ({ upc, price, weight }) => ({ upc, price, weight }),
          argsFromKeys: (key) => ({ key }),
        }],
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  These multiple entry points accommodate types with multiple keys across services that rely on a
  central service to join them, for example:
  - Catalog service: `type Product { upc }`
  - Vendors service: `type Product { upc id }`
  - Reviews service: `type Product { id }`

  Given this graph, the possible traversals require the Vendors service to provide entry points for
  each unique key format:
  - `Catalog > Vendors > Reviews`
  - `Catalog < Vendors > Reviews`
  - `Catalog < Vendors < Reviews`

  Is it highly recommended that you enable query batching for subschemas with multiple entry points.

  - @graphql-tools/utils@7.7.0

## 7.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 24926654: Deprecates the `MergeTypeConfig.computedFields` setting (with backwards-compatible
  warning) in favor of new computed field configuration written as:

  ```js
  merge: {
    MyType: {
      fields: {
        myComputedField: {
          selectionSet: '{ weight }',
          computed: true,
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  A field-level `selectionSet` specifies field dependencies while the `computed` setting structures
  the field in a way that assures it is always selected with this data provided. The `selectionSet`
  is intentionally generic to support possible future uses. This new pattern organizes all
  field-level configuration (including `canonical`) into a single structure.

## 7.0.9

### Patch Changes

- d9b82a2e: fix(delegate) fix array check
- d9b82a2e: enhance(stitch) canonical merged type and field definitions. Use the @canonical
  directive to promote preferred type and field descriptions into the combined gateway schema.

## 7.0.8

### Patch Changes

- cd5da458: fix(stitch): type merging for nested root types

  Because root types do not usually require selectionSets, a nested root type proxied to a remote
  service may end up having an empty selectionSet, if the nested root types only includes fields
  from a different subservice.

  Empty selection sets return null, but, in this case, it should return an empty object. We can
  force this behavior by including the \_\_typename field which exists on every schema.

  Addresses #2347.

  In the future, we may want to include short-circuiting behavior that when delegating to composite
  fields, if an empty selection set is included, an empty object is returned rather than null. This
  short-circuiting behavior would be complex for lists, as it would be unclear the length of the
  list...

- cd5da458: fix(delegate): resolve external values only once

  Because items in a list may be identical and the defaultMergedResolver mutates those objects when
  resolving them as external values, a check is required so that the mutation happens only once.

  Partially addresses #2304

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- be1a1575: ## Breaking Changes:

  #### Schema Generation and Decoration API (`@graphql-tools/schema`)
  - Resolver validation options should now be set to `error`, `warn` or `ignore` rather than `true`
    or `false`. In previous versions, some of the validators caused errors to be thrown, while some
    issued warnings. This changes brings consistency to validator behavior.

  - The `allowResolversNotInSchema` has been renamed to `requireResolversToMatchSchema`, to
    harmonize the naming convention of all the validators. The default setting of
    `requireResolversToMatchSchema` is `error`, matching the previous behavior.

  #### Schema Delegation (`delegateToSchema` & `@graphql-tools/delegate`)
  - The `delegateToSchema` return value has matured and been formalized as an `ExternalObject`, in
    which all errors are integrated into the GraphQL response, preserving their initial path. Those
    advanced users accessing the result directly will note the change in error handling. This also
    allows for the deprecation of unnecessary helper functions including `slicedError`, `getErrors`,
    `getErrorsByPathSegment` functions. Only external errors with missing or invalid paths must
    still be preserved by annotating the remote object with special properties. The new
    `getUnpathedErrors` function is therefore necessary for retrieving only these errors. Note also
    the new `annotateExternalObject` and `mergeExternalObjects` functions, as well as the renaming
    of `handleResult` to `resolveExternalValue`.

  - Transform types and the `applySchemaTransforms` are now relocated to the `delegate` package;
    `applyRequestTransforms`/`applyResultTransforms` functions have been deprecated, however, as
    this functionality has been replaced since v6 by the `Transformer` abstraction.

  - The `transformRequest`/`transformResult` methods are now provided additional `delegationContext`
    and `transformationContext` arguments -- these were introduced in v6, but previously optional.

  - The `transformSchema` method may wish to create additional delegating resolvers and so it is now
    provided the `subschemaConfig` and final (non-executable) `transformedSchema` parameters. As in
    v6, the `transformSchema` is kicked off once to produce the non-executable version, and then, if
    a wrapping schema is being generated, proxying resolvers are created with access to the
    (non-executable) initial result. In v7, the individual `transformSchema` methods also get access
    to the result of the first run, if necessary, they can create additional wrapping schema
    proxying resolvers.

  - `applySchemaTransforms` parameters have been updated to match and support the `transformSchema`
    parameters above.

  #### Remote Schemas & Wrapping (`wrapSchema`, `makeRemoteExecutableSchema`, and `@graphql-tools/wrap`)
  - `wrapSchema` and `generateProxyingResolvers` now only take a single options argument with named
    properties of type `SubschemaConfig`. The previously possible shorthand version with first
    argument consisting of a `GraphQLSchema` and second argument representing the transforms should
    be reworked as a `SubschemaConfig` object.

  - Similarly, the `ICreateProxyingResolverOptions` interface that provides the options for the
    `createProxyingResolver` property of `SubschemaConfig` options has been adjusted. The `schema`
    property previously could be set to a `GraphQLSchema` or a `SubschemaConfig` object. This
    property has been removed in favor of a `subschemaConfig` property that will always be a
    `SubschemaConfig` object. The `transforms` property has been removed; transforms should be
    included within the `SubschemaConfig` object.`

  - The format of the wrapping schema has solidified. All non-root fields are expected to use
    identical resolvers, either `defaultMergedResolver` or a custom equivalent, with root fields
    doing the hard work of proxying. Support for custom merged resolvers throught
    `createMergedResolver` has been deprecated, as custom merging resolvers conflicts when using
    stitching's type merging, where resolvers are expected to be identical across subschemas.

  - The `WrapFields` transform's `wrappingResolver` option has been removed, as this complicates
    multiple wrapping layers, as well as planned functionality to wrap subscription root fields in
    potentially multiple layers, as the wrapping resolvers may be different in different layers.
    Modifying resolvers can still be performed by use of an additional transform such as
    `TransformRootFields` or `TransformObjectFields`.

  - The `ExtendSchema` transform has been removed, as it is conceptually simpler just to use
    `stitchSchemas` with one subschema.

  - The `ReplaceFieldsWithFragment`, `AddFragmentsByField`, `AddSelectionSetsByField`, and
    `AddMergedTypeSelectionSets` transforms has been removed, as they are superseded by the
    `AddSelectionSets` and `VisitSelectionSets` transforms. The `AddSelectionSets` purposely takes
    parsed SDL rather than strings, to nudge end users to parse these strings at build time (when
    possible), rather than at runtime. Parsing of selection set strings can be performed using the
    `parseSelectionSet` function from `@graphql-tools/utils`.

  #### Schema Stitching (`stitchSchemas` & `@graphql-tools/stitch`)
  - `stitchSchemas`'s `mergeTypes` option is now true by default! This causes the `onTypeConflict`
    option to be ignored by default. To use `onTypeConflict` to select a specific type instead of
    simply merging, simply set `mergeTypes` to false.

  - `schemas` argument has been deprecated, use `subschemas`, `typeDefs`, or `types`, depending on
    what you are stitching.

  - When using batch delegation in type merging, the `argsFromKeys` function is now set only via the
    `argsFromKeys` property. Previously, if `argsFromKeys` was absent, it could be read from `args`.

  - Support for fragment hints has been removed in favor of selection set hints.

  - `stitchSchemas` now processes all `GraphQLSchema` and `SubschemaConfig` subschema input into new
    `Subschema` objects, handling schema config directives such aso`@computed` as well as generating
    the final transformed schema, stored as the `transformedSchema` property, if transforms are
    used. Signatures of the `onTypeConflict`, `fieldConfigMerger`, and `inputFieldConfigMerger` have
    been updated to include metadata related to the original and transformed subschemas. Note the
    property name change for `onTypeConflict` from `schema` to `subschema`.

  #### Mocking (`addMocksToSchema` and `@graphql-tools/mock`)
  - Mocks returning objects with fields set as functions are now operating according to upstream
    graphql-js convention, i.e. these functions take three arguments, `args`, `context`, and `info`
    with `parent` available as `this` rather than as the first argument.

  #### Other Utilities (`@graphql-tools/utils`)
  - `filterSchema`'s `fieldFilter` will now filter _all_ fields across Object, Interface, and Input
    types. For the previous Object-only behavior, switch to the `objectFieldFilter` option.
  - Unused `fieldNodes` utility functions have been removed.
  - Unused `typeContainsSelectionSet` function has been removed, and `typesContainSelectionSet` has
    been moved to the `stitch` package.
  - Unnecessary `Operation` type has been removed in favor of `OperationTypeNode` from upstream
    graphql-js.
  - As above, `applySchemaTransforms`/`applyRequestTransforms`/`applyResultTransforms` have been
    removed from the `utils` package, as they are implemented elsewhere or no longer necessary.
